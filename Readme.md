</div>


This design and implementation guide covers the basics of creating a RESTful web service using Oracle's Java EE platform. Depending on your requirements, you can extend this example with features like error handling, logging, and authentication.

**Additional Considerations:**

***Exception Handling***: Implement a global exception handler to manage errors gracefully.

***Security***: Secure the API using OAuth or other authentication mechanisms.

***Documentation***: Use Swagger or OpenAPI to document the API for better maintainability and user understanding.
